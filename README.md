My first game, a card game with a dynamic turn system, where you have to use said cards that cost mana or actions, like moving through the battlefield, that cost time
Right now it's realy only the bare bones of my vision of a "game".
So far you can only cast cards, with some variance in their effects, you can move and you can damage, and get damaged by, an enemy, using the cards.
More stuff is to come, though.
